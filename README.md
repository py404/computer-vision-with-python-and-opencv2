# Computer Vision with Python and OpenCV2
I have created this project for educational and learning purposes as well as documenting my journey into Computer Vision using Python.

I used Python 3 (version 3.7) and OpenCV2 (opencv-python) for this project.

I have compiled blog posts on this project at my personal blog [https://py404.github.io/categories/](https://py404.github.io/categories/?target='_blank'). Look for "Computer vision with python and opencv2" category.

For each blog post there is one folder in the main repository with a jupyter notebook and/or a python script, with other resources like images and videos.

Project structure below:
